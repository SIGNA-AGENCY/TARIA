# TARIA Principles

1. Friction must die
Anything that slows the path from idea to publication is a defect. Writing should flow directly into presence. Tools exist to disappear, not to be operated.

2. Ownership is default
Users own their content, their data, and their presence. Export must always be possible. Leaving must always be easy. No hostage platforms.

3. Simplicity over features
Complexity is technical debt. Databases, plugins, frameworks, and bloated interfaces are removed unless they are absolutely necessary. The system earns every component it keeps.

4. Performance is a consequence of purity
Speed is not an optimization layer. It is the natural result of building with minimal moving parts.

5. Privacy is structural
No tracking. No personal data collection. Metadata stripped by default. Trust is achieved by architecture, not policy.

6. Resilience by design
Systems must survive hostile environments. Portable files. Simple infrastructure. Easy backups. Kill switches. No single points of failure.

7. Conversation over interface
Typing and dialogue are the most natural human control systems. The product should feel like speaking intent, not navigating software.

8. Governance is enforceable
Brand rules and communication standards must be executable, not advisory. Identity is enforced by the system, not dependent on human discipline.

9. Intelligence speaks in language
Analytics exist to create clarity, not dashboards. Insight is delivered as explanation, not charts.

10. Global first
Native RTL. Multi language by default. Onion and SMS pathways. Built for voices everywhere, not just the privileged web.
